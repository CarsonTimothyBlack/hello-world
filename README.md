# hello-world
My first repository

Look at this "project"!

It may be small at first, but I have to start somewhere. Hi, I'm Carson, and I want to learn how to code. I plan on spending every day, using the little free time I have to develop and sharpen those skills. This has been my first week. I have been going through an intro to javascript course through codecademy, but plan on eventually moving to FreeCodeCamp, as I hear it encourages you to do projects. We'll just see where my journey takes me, won't we!
