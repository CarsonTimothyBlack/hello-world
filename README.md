# hello-world

Look at this "project"!

It may be small at first, but I have to start somewhere. Hi, I'm Carson, and I want to learn how to code. I plan on spending every day, using the little free time I have to develop and sharpen those skills. This has been my first week. I have been going through an intro to javascript course through codecademy, but plan on eventually moving to FreeCodeCamp, as I hear it encourages you to do projects. We'll just see where my journey takes me, won't we!

So, I'm still figuring out github. And, I'm still learning code. I haven't started a project yet, because I'm not sure just where to start. However, I've been trucking through codecademy and I did the first temperature conversion project. It was fun, and I experimented a bit to make it so the temperature for each type would log to the console, depending on what you set for Kelvin's value. Here's what it looked like.

//This is a constant variable for kelvin
const kelvin = 300;
//This constant variable converts kelvin to celsius
const celsius = kelvin - 273;
//This value changing variable converts celsius to fahrenheit
let fahrenheit = celsius * (9 / 5) + 32;
//This change to "fahrenheit" variable will round it down to nearest integer
fahrenheit = Math.floor(fahrenheit);
console.log(`The temperature is ${fahrenheit} degrees Fahrenheit.`);
const newton = Math.floor(celsius * (33/100));
console.log(`The temperature is ${newton} degrees Newton.`);
console.log(`The temperature is ${kelvin} degrees Kelvin.`);
console.log(`The temperature is ${celsius} degrees Celsius.`);

I guess you could call that a project, right? It may be small, but it's a start!
